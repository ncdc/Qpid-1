To edit the website, check out the /site repo area:

    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/qpid/site

The HTML files for the site reside in the docs directory, where a README
can be found to describe the process of adding new content.

It is no longer necessary to generate the main website pages, the live files
are now edited directly, and are deployed to the web server after check in.
