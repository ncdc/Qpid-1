<h2><a name="GettingInvolved-ProjectEtiquette"></a>Project Etiquette</h2>

<p>Please read and digest our <a href="qpid_project_etiquette_guide.html" title="Qpid Project Etiquette Guide">Qpid Project Etiquette Guide</a>. This is a key guide for new contributers and required reading.</p>

<h2><a name="GettingInvolved-Becomingacommitter%3A"></a>Becoming a Committer</h2>

<p>Qpid uses the following guidelines for voting in new committers. First off we would like new committers to have provided meaningful contribution to the project. By contributions we include development (tests, features, examples) or documentation through patches and interactions with the project through lists and JIRA. It should be noted that as we send our JIRA to the dev list, thus some people filter the JIRA's to limit traffic. It is thus good to cross post something to the dev list every now and again, if the discussion is being held primarily on JIRA.</p>

<p>The key question is what does the Qpid project consider to be a meaningful contribution to be come a committer. As this bar is set for all new commiters Qpid will be conservative in general with adding new committers.</p>

<p>The Qpid project will look to see if someone consistently provides quality contributions and interactions with the project over a period of several weeks. Based on that the PMC will vote the new committers onto the project. </p>

<p>If you have any question please mail <a href="mailto:dev@qpid.apache.org">dev@qpid.apache.org</a> or <a href="mailto:private@qpid.apache.org">private@qpid.apache.org</a> </p>

<p>Many thanks for you interest,<br />

The Qpid Team.</p>
