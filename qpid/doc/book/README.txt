The documentation in this directory is written in DocBook 4.5. The
original content was taken from the Apache Qpid Wiki. 

1. Building the Documentation

You need the following to build the documentation:

- Apache FOP, version 0.95 or higher
- Docbook 4.5
- Docbook XSL stylesheets - Tested with xsl-stylesheets (1.75.2 & 1.65.1-2)
- xsltproc
- xmllint

On many Linux machines, these can usually be installed from standard
repos. For instance, on Fedora they can be installed as follows:

$ sudo yum install fop docbook-dtds docbook-style-xsl libxslt libxml2

After installing, use make to build the documentation:

$ make

By default, the Makefile builds a PDF. It supports the following
targets:

pdf	Make the PDF
html	Make HTML pages
all	Make both PDF and HTML
clean	Delete the build and output directories


You will see quite a few error messages. Many of these are due to
unresolved links, and these should go away. Many are due to the
verbosity of Apache FOP, which generates many warnings.

2. Editing Tools

For Emacs, I like nxml-mode, especially if you learn how to use tag
completion, outlining, etc.  This is described in some detail in
http://www.dpawson.co.uk/relaxng/nxml/info.html. 

For vi, the macros described in this Linux Journal article may be
helpful: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7737.

Commercial XML editors provide good support for DocBook. On Windows, I
like Stylus Studio (http://www.stylusstudio.com/). On Linux, I like
Oxygen (http://www.oxygenxml.com/).
