	  <para>
            Qpid has a JMX management interface that exposes a number of
            components of the running broker.
            You can find out more about the features exposed by the JMX
            interfaces <xref linkend="qpid_Qpid-20Management-20Features"/>.

                      <para>
                        Recent versions of the broker can make use of SSL to
                        encrypt their RMI based JMX connections. If a broker
                        being connected to is making use of this ability then
                        additional console configuration may be required,
                        particularly when using self-signed certificates. See
                        <xref linkend="qpid_Management-20Console-20Security"/> for details.

	  <note>
	    <title>JMXMP based connections</title>
	    <para>
	      In previous releases of Qpid (M4 and below) the broker
	      JMX connections could make use of the JMXMPConnector for
	      additional security over its default RMI based JMX
	      configuration. This is no longer the case, with SSL
	      encrypted RMI being the favored approach going forward.
	      However, if you wish to connect to an older broker using
	      JMXMP the console will support this so long as the
	      <emphasis>jmxremote_optional.jar</emphasis> file is provided to it.
	      For details see <xref linkend="qpid_Management-20Console-20Security"/>.
