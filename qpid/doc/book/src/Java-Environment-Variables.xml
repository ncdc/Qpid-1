  <para>
            There are two main Qpid environment variables which are required
            to be set for Qpid deployments, QPID_HOME and QPID_WORK.
          </para>
  <para>
            QPID_HOME - This variable is used to tell the Qpid broker where
            it's installed home is, which is in turn used to find dependency
            JARs which Qpid uses.
          </para>
  <para>
            QPID_WORK - This variable is used by Qpid when creating all
            'writeable' directories that it uses. This includes the log
            directory and the storage location for any BDB instances in use
            by your deployment (if you're using persistence with BDB). If you
            do not set this variable, then the broker will default (in the
            qpid-server script) to use the current user's homedir as the root
            directory for creating the writeable locations that it uses.
          </para>

    <title>
            Setting
            Max Memory for the broker
          </title>
  <para>
            If you simply start the Qpid broker, it will default to use a
            -Xmx setting of 1024M for the broker JVM. However, we would
            recommend that you make the maximum -Xmx heap size available, if
            possible, of 3Gb (for 32-bit platforms).
          </para>
  <para>
            You can control the memory setting for your broker by setting the
            QPID_JAVA_MEM variable before starting the broker e.g. -Xmx3668m
            . Enclose your value within quotes if you also specify a -Xms
            value. The value in use is echo'd by the qpid-server script on
            startup.
