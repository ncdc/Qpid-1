            ACL Formats
          </title>Apache Qpid : Qpid ACLs
            This page last changed on Nov 18, 2008 by ritchiem.
          <para>
            The Qpid project has two ACL implementations. An initial version
            of ACLs was added to the Java Broker for M2.1 that uses XML
            configuration. For M4 a new format was designed to be implemented
            by both C++ and Java brokers. M4 release includes the initial C++
            implementation and M5 is expected to include the Java
            implementation.

            To aid users in defining their ACLs we have a user guide for each
            of the ACL formats.
