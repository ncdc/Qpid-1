           <para>
            QMan is a management bridge for Qpid. It allows external clients
            to manage and monitor one or more Qpid brokers.

            Please note: All WS-DM related concerns have to be considered
            part of M5 release.
          </para><para>
            QMan exposes the broker management interfaces using Java
            Management Extensions (JMX) and / or OASIS Web Services
            Distributed Management (WSDM). While the first one is supposed to
            be used by java based clients only the latter is an interoperable
            protocol that enables management clients to access and receive
            notifications of management-enabled resources using Web Services.
          </para><para>
            QMan can be easily integrated in your preexisting system in
            different ways :

            <listitem><para>As a standalone application : in this case it runs as a
            server. More specifically it enables communication via RMI (for
            JMX) or via HTTP (for WS-DM); Note that when the WS-DM adapter is
            used the JMX interface is not exposed;
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>As a deployable unit : it is also available as a standard
            Java web application (war); This is useful when there's a
            preexisting Application Server in your environment and you don't
            want start another additional server in order to run QMan.
