<section id="Configuring-Group-Providers">
  <title>Configuring Group Providers</title>
  <para>
    The Java broker utilises GroupProviders to allow assigning users to groups for use in <link linkend="Configuring-ACLS">ACLs</link>. Following authentication by a given <link linkend="Configuring-Authentication-Mechanisms">Authentication Provider</link>, the configured Group Providers are consulted to allowing assignment of GroupPrincipals for a given authenticated user.

    <para>
      The FileGroupManager allows specifying group membership in a flat file on disk, and is also exposed for inspection and update through the brokers HTTP management interface.
    </para>
    <para>
      To enable the FileGroupManager, add the following configuration to the config.xml, adjusting the groupFile attribute value to match your desired groups file location.

            The groups file has the following format:
          </para>
            <programlisting>
    # &lt;GroupName&gt;.users = &lt;comma deliminated user list&gt;
    # For example:

    administrators.users = admin,manager
</programlisting>
          <para>
            Only users can be added to a group currently, not other groups. Usernames can't contain commas.
          </para><para>
            Lines starting with a '#' are treated as comments when opening the file, but these are not preserved when the broker updates the file due to changes made through the management interface.
