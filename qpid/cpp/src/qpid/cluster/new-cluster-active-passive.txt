* Active/passive cluster implementation

The active-active cluster can be used in an active-passive mode. In
this mode we would like the cluster to be as efficient as a strictly
active-passive implementation.

An active/passive implementation requires a subset of the active/active approach:
- drop Queue ownership and locking
- replicate subset of Cluster interface, don't need to know all message disposition.

Can re-use:
- cluster membership
- new member updates
- store integration

Simpler implementation of broker::Cluster:
- act like distributed MessageStore. Don't need acquisition details.
- can do immediate local enqueue and still guarantee order.
- can use smaller message IDs: just sequence number. Can be implicit.

Extra requirements:
- Passive members refuse client connections and redirect to active member.
- Choose new active member when the active dies.
- On failover, clients keep trying till they find the active member.

** Active/active vs. active passive

Active/active benefits:
- Total # connections: practical 60k limit per node.
- Handle client losing connectivity to one cluster node - can fail over to any.
- Some load sharing: reading from client + multicast only done on direct node.

Active/active drawbacks:
- Co-ordinating message allocation impacts performance.

Active/passive benefits:
- Don't need message allocation strategy, can feed consumers at top speed.

Active/passive drawbacks:
- Can't help clients with no connectivity to the active member.
- Clients must find the single active node in failover.
