/**
 * Represents an address to which messages can be sent and from which
 * messages can be received. Often a simple name is sufficient for
 * this, however this can be augmented with a subject pattern and
 * options.
 * 
 * All parts of an address can be specified in a string of the
 * following form:
 * 
 * &lt;address&gt; [ / &lt;subject&gt; ] ; [ { &lt;key&gt; : &lt;value&gt; , ... } ]
 * 
 * Here the &lt;address&gt; is a simple name for the addressed
 * entity and &lt;subject&gt; is a subject or subject pattern for
 * messages sent to or received from this address. The options are
 * specified as a series of key value pairs enclosed in curly brackets
 * (denoting a map). Values can be nested maps, or lists (which are
 * denoted as a comma separated list of values inside square brackets,
 * e.g. [a, b, c]).
 * 
 * The currently supported options are as follows:
 *
 * <table border=0> 
 * 
 * <tr valign=top>
 *   <td>create</td>
 *   <td>Indicate whether the address should be automatically created
 *       or not. Can be one of <i>always</i>, <i>never</i>,
 *       <i>sender</i> or <i>receiver</i>. The properties of the node
 *       to be created can be specified via the node options (see
 *       below).
 *   </td>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * <tr valign=top>
 *   <td>assert</td>
 *   <td>Indicate whether or not to assert any specified node
 *       properties(see below) match the address. Can be one of
 *       <i>always</i>, <i>never</i>, <i>sender</i> or
 *       <i>receiver</i>.
 *   </td>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * <tr valign=top>
 *   <td>delete</td>
 *   <td>Indicate whether or not to delete the addressed node when a
 *       sender or receiver is cancelled. Can be one of <i>always</i>,
 *       <i>never</i>, <i>sender</i> or <i>receiver</i>.
 *   </td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr valign=top>
 *   <td>node</td>
 *   <td>A nested map describing properties of the addressed
 *       node. Current properties supported are type (topic or queue),
 *       durable (boolean), x-declare and x-bindings.
 *   </td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr valign=top>
 *   <td>link</td>
 *   <td>A nested map through which properties of the 'link' from
 *       sender/receiver to node can be configured. Current propeties
 *       are name, durable, realiability, x-declare, x-subscribe and
 *       x-bindings.
 *   </td>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * For receivers there is one other option of interest:
 * 
 * <table border=0 valign=top>
 * <tr valign=top><td>mode</td><td>(only relevant for queues)
 * indicates whether the subscribe should consume (the default) or
 * merely browse the messages. Valid values are 'consume' and
 * 'browse'</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * 
 * An address has value semantics.
