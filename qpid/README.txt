Apache Qpid is a high-speed, language independent, platform
independent enterprise messaging system. It currently provides two
messaging brokers (one implemented in C++, one implemented in Java),
and messaging client libraries for Java JMS, C++, C# .NET, Python,
Ruby, and WCF. The messaging protocol for Apache Qpid is AMQP
(Advanced Message Queuing Protocol). You can read more about Qpid
