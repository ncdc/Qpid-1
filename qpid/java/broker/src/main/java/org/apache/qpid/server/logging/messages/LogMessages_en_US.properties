# LogMessages used within the Java Broker as originally defined on the wiki:
#
# http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/qpid/Status+Update+Design#StatusUpdateDesign-InitialStatusMessages
#  
# Technical Notes:
#  This is a standard Java Properties file so white space is respected at the
#  end of the lines. This file is processed in a number of ways.
# 1) ResourceBundle
#   This file is loaded through a ResourceBundle named LogMessages. the en_US
#   addition to the file is the localisation. Additional localisations can be
#   provided and will automatically be selected based on the <locale> value in
#   the config.xml. The default is en_US.
#
# 2) MessasgeFormat
#  Each entry is prepared with the Java Core MessageFormat methods. Therefore
#  most functionality you can do via MessageFormat can be done here:
#
#  http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html
#
#  The cavet here is that only default String and number FormatTypes can be used.
#  This is due to the processing described in 3 below. If support for date, time
#  or choice is requried then the GenerateLogMessages class should be updated to
#  provide support.
#
#  Format Note:
#   As mentioned earlier white space in this file is very important. One thing
#  in particular to note is the way MessageFormat peforms its replacements.
#  The replacement text will totally replace the {xxx} section so there will be
#  no addtion of white space or removal e.g.
#     MSG = Text----{0}----
#  When given parameter 'Hello' result in text:
#     Text----Hello----
#
#  For simple arguments this is expected however when using Style formats then
#  it can be a little unexepcted. In particular a common pattern is used for
#  number replacements : {0,number,#}. This is used in the Broker to display an
#  Integer simply as the Integer with no formating. e.g new Integer(1234567)
#  becomes the String "1234567" which is can be contrasted with the pattern
#  without a style format field : {0,number} which becomes string "1,234,567".
#
#  What you may not expect is that {0,number, #} would produce the String " 1234567"
#  note the space after the ','   here      /\   has resulted in a space  /\ in
#  the output.
#
#  More details on the SubformatPattern can be found on the API link above.
#
# 3) GenerateLogMessage/Velocity Macro
#  This is the first and final stage of processing that this file goes through.
#   1) Class Generation:
#      The GenerateLogMessage processes this file and uses the velocity Macro
#      to create classes with static methods to perform the logging and give us
#      compile time validation.
#
#   2) Property Processing:
#      During the class generation the message properties ({x}) are identified
#      and used to create the method signature.
#
#   3) Option Processing:
#      The Classes perform final formatting of the messages at runtime based on
#      optional parameters that are defined within the message. Optional
#      paramters are enclosed in square brackets e.g. [optional].
#
#  To provide fixed log messages as required by the Technical Specification:
#  http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/qpid/Operational+Logging+-+Status+Update+-+Technical+Specification#OperationalLogging-StatusUpdate-TechnicalSpecification-Howtoprovidefixedlogmessages
#
#  This file is processed by Velocity to create a number of classes that contain
#  static methods that provide LogMessages in the code to provide compile time
#  validation.
#
#  For details of what processing is done see GenerateLogMessages.
#
#  What a localiser or developer need know is the following:
#
#  The Property structure is important is it defines how the class and methods
#  will be built.
#
#  Class Generation:
#  =================
#
#  Each class of messages will be split in to their own <Class>Messages.java
#  Currently the following classes are created and are populated with the
#  messages that bear their 3-digit type identifier:
#
#        Class              | Type
#      ---------------------|--------
#        Broker             |  BKR
#        ManagementConsole  |  MNG
#        VirtualHost        |  VHT
#        MessageStore       |  MST
#        Connection         |  CON
#        Channel            |  CHN
#        Queue              |  QUE
#        Exchange           |  EXH
#        Binding            |  BND
#        Subscription       |  SUB
#
#  Property Processing:
#  ====================
#
#   Each property is then processed by the GenerateLogMessages class to identify
#   The number and type of parameters, {x} entries. Parameters are defaulted to
#   String types but the use of FormatType number (e.g.{0,number}) will result
#   in a Number type being used. These parameters are then used to build the
#   method parameter list. e.g:
#   Property:
#    BRK-1003 = Shuting down : {0} port {1,number,#}
#   becomes Method:
#    public static LogMessage BRK_1003(String param1, Number param2)
#
#   This improves our compile time validation of log message content and
#   ensures that change in the message format does not accidentally cause
#   erroneous messages.
#
#  Option Processing:
#  ====================
#
#  Options are identified in the log message as being surrounded by square
#  brackets ([ ]). These optional values can themselves contain paramters
#  however nesting of options is not permitted. Identification is performed on
#  first matchings so give the message:
#   Msg = Log Message [option1] [option2]
#  Two options will be identifed and enabled to select text 'option1 and
#  'option2'.
#
#  The nesting of a options is not supported and will provide
#  unexpected results. e.g. Using Message:
#   Msg = Log Message [option1 [sub-option2]]
#
#  The options will be 'option1 [sub-option2' and 'sub-option2'. The first
#  option includes the second option as the nesting is not detected.
#
#  The detected options are presented in the method signature as boolean options
#  numerically identified by their position in the message. e.g.
#   Property:
#    CON-1001 = Open : Client ID {0} [: Protocol Version : {1}]
#  becomes Method:
#    public static LogMessage CON_1001(String param1, String param2, boolean opt1)
#
#  The value of 'opt1' will show/hide the option in the message. Note that
#  'param2' is still required however a null value can be used if the optional
#  section is not desired.
#
#  Again here the importance of white space needs to be highlighted.
#  Looking at the QUE-1001 message as an example. The first thought on how this
#  would look would be as follows:
# QUE-1001 = Create : Owner: {0} [AutoDelete] [Durable] [Transient] [Priority: {1,number,#}]
#  Each option is correctly defined so the text that is defined will appear when
#  selected. e.g. 'AutoDelete'. However, what may not be immediately apparent is
#  the white space. Using the above definition of QUE-1001 if we were to print
#  the message with only the Priority option displayed it would appear as this:
#  "Create : Owner: guest    Priority: 1"
#  Note the spaces here   /\ This is because only the text between the brackets
#  has been removed.
#
#  Each option needs to include white space to correctly format the message. So
#  the correct definition of QUE-1001 is as follows:
# QUE-1001 = Create : Owner: {0}[ AutoDelete][ Durable][ Transient][ Priority: {1,number,#}]
#  Note that white space is included with each option and there is no extra
#  white space between the options. As a result the output with just Priority
#  enabled is as follows:
#  "Create : Owner: guest Priority: 1"
#
#  The final processing that is done in the generation is the conversion of the
#  property name. As a '-' is an illegal character in the method name it is
#  converted to '_' This processing gives the final method signature as follows:
#   <Class>Message.<Type>_<Number>(<parmaters>,<options>)
